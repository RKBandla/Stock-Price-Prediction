In today’s fast-paced financial markets, making accurate predictions is crucial for investors and traders alike. 
Traditional statistical methods often fall short in capturing the complex patterns and dynamics of stock prices.

The stock market is known for being volatile, dynamic, & nonlinear. Accurate stock price prediction is extremely challenging because of multiple factors. 
But, all of this also means that there’s a lot of data to find patterns in. So, we keep exploring analytics techniques to detect stock market trends. 
So, they can be analyzed as a sequence of discrete-time data .Despite the volatility, stock prices aren’t just randomly 
generated numbers.

The basic assumption of any traditional Machine Learning (ML) based model is that all the observations should be independent of each other, meaning there shouldn’t be
any association between each data record/row. However, in the case of any time series data, each observation is dependent upon past observations. For example, the stock price in
the market depends upon the past day (or days) prices which generally define their trend. However, there are many other factors as well that define the market prices.

5.Evaluating and Improving Predictions

1.Importing and Cleaning Data:
The first step in building a stock price prediction model in Python is to import and clean the data.
This involves gathering data on the stocks you want to analyze, organizing it in a structured format, 
and cleaning the data by removing any missing values or outliers..
There are various sources to get stock price data such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance,Alpha Vantage, Quandl, and more.
Once you have the data, you can use Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library,to load and clean the data.

2.Split the Data into Training/Test Sets:
After cleaning the data, you need to split it into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, 
while the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. You can use the Scikit-learn library to split the data into training and testing sets

3.Creating and Training the Model:
Next, you need to create a model that can learn patterns in the data and make predictions. There are various models available to predict stock prices, 
including Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM, and more.

4.Making Predictions:
Once you have trained the model, you can use it to make predictions on the testing set. You can use the predict() function of the model to generate predictions 
for each time step in the testing set.
  
5.Evaluating and Improving Predictions:
Finally, you need to evaluate the model's performance and identify ways to improve the predictions. You can use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), 
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate the model's performance.
